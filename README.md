script.myepisodes
=================

XBMC plugin for [MyEpisodes](http://myepisodes.com)

This plugin will set TV shows episodes you've seen as watched on MyEpisodes.
It will also add the the TV show to your account if it was not already there.

This was done mainly because I'm too lazy to do it by hand and I watch 98% of
my video through XBMC.
