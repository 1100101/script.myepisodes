script.myepisodes
=================

XBMC plugin for [MyEpisodes](http://myepisodes.com)

This plugin will set TV shows episodes you've seen as watched on MyEpisodes.
It will also add the the TV show to your account if it was not already there.

This was done mainly because I'm too lazy to do it by hand and I watch 98% of
my video through XBMC.

build
=====
To build the plugin, simply, invoke build.sh, it will create a zip file of your
plugin.

install
=======

Using the GUI of XBMC, choose to install your plugin as a zip file, find your
zip file, and you're done !
